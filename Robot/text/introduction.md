## Why robots matter? 
---
Increasingly, dairy producers are facing labor shortages. To reduce labor requirement and potentially increase milk output, some producers have adopted robotic milking systems and many others are said to be considering robotic milking for similar reasons. To determine whether to invest in robotic milking or hold off until the case strengthens in the future, this online tool facilitates the cost and benefit analysis of robotic milking for your farm.   


Installing robots would bring about changes in many parts of the existing operation and require a large-scale, long-term investment (including a major renovation of the barn or the construction of a new barn). Assessing the potential impact of robotic milking at your farm depends heavily on assumptions about the changes brought by the investment and the prospects for the industry as a whole.       

Key questions pertaining to such assumptions include:

+ How much does robotic milking save labor in *your operation*? 
+ How much does robotic milking enhance *your milk outputs*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for labor shortage and how will it affect *your labor expense*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for income over feed cost (IOFC) margin at *your farm*? 

This online tool assists you with understanding how these factors influence the anticipated change under robotic milking for your operation. To put the costs and benefits of robotic milking into perspective, parallel assessments are conducted for alternative investments such as retrofitting existing parlors or installing new parlors.  



## Where to start? 
---
1. The first step is to enter your data under the **Data Entry** tab.  We provide several sets of starting values, of which you will select the most suitable to your operation. However, the results depend on the data and assumptions you provide about *your operation*, *projected changes* under robotic milking, and *market factors*. The analysis involves many data inputs, so please keep in mind that you can download the existing data-inputs as an Excel file and upload it later. Those eager to preview the analysis results may do so using the default values. To initiate the analysis, scroll down the page and turn on **Calculation Switch**.  

2. The main results will be shown under three tabs: **Data Entry**, **Partial Budget**, and **Cash Flow**. The three share the same underlying calculations but show different presentations of the results with each focusing on a different aspect. 
  * **Data Entry**: Once the calculation switch is turned on, interactive *dashboard features* will appear on the bottom half of the page. These features show the net annual impact and its components (categorized into: milk income minus feed cost, labor plus repair cost, cost of capital, inflation adjustments, and miscellaneous items).  They are updated as you make changes in your data inputs. For example, try adjusting the cost of robots, projected increase in milk output, labor savings, or inflation rates and observe the change in the results. You can use this feature to interactively develop your intuition into the economics of robotic milking.  
  <br>
  *  **Partial Budget**: With the summary results in the Data Entry tab in mind, you can examine the details of item-by-item changes under robotic milking. The top half of the page presents a Partial Budget Analysis for a given budget year, showing positive and negative impact. The bottom half of the page begins with the positive-minus-negative change and summarizes the calculations for inflation adjustments and tax treatments, yielding before-tax and after-tax net impacts. Additionally, the analysis of breakeven wage is provided.        
  <br>
  *  **Cash Flow**: Finally, you can examine the year-by-year cash flow for investment suitability. Given the long-term nature of investment, understanding the impact of loan payments, tax payments, and tax deductions on the cash flow is crucial.  We derive the *After-tax Net Annual Impact* as an annualized net present value (NPV) of after-tax cash flows. The results presented in the Data Entry, Partial Budget, and Cash Flow tabs all lead to this value. In fact, the presentations in the Data Entry and Partial Budget tabs are designed to help you better understand the underling cash flows by displaying the components and snapshots of the impact calculations. Instead of serving as a blackbox calculator, this online tool is designed for increasing your understanding of the *economics* of robotic milking to help you with your investment decisions.   
  <br>
  * **Note:** Each of the three sections contains the results for three investment profiles labeled as *Robots*, *Retrofit Parlors*, and *New Parlors*. The summary of the three profiles is provided under **Summary** tab.   


## What's more?

1. Additional tools are provided for assessing the robustness of your results with respect to a change in a key variable (**Sensitivity Analysis**) and changes in a set of related variables (**Scenario Analysis**).

    * **Sensitivity Analysis**: Focusing on ten variables that are deemed most important, you can assess how the results hold up under a significant error in your assumption or an unforeseen change of course in the economy.

2. An optional feature allows for simulating a two-step investment process for the new milking system (Robots, Retrofit Parlors, or New Parlors) and the related housing. The initial investment is a part or all of the housing investment, and the forthcoming investment is the remainder of the housing investment and the installment of the new milking system. This feature can be accessed by setting *Year of Investment* for the milking system (under *Finance* section in *Data Entry* tab) to be greater than zero. Such a strategy may be attractive for those who want to smooth out cash flows or those who want to adopt modern barn construction while waiting for further development of the milking system technology.
