### Why robots matter? 
---
Increasing labor shortage is turning many dairy producers' attention to robotic milking systems. Robotic milking has a potential to drastically reduce labor requirement and moderately increase milk production. Implementing the robots affects many parts of the existing operation and management and requires a large-scale, long-term investment, including significant changes to the barn. Assessing the costs and benefits of robotic milking is complex and, more importantly, depends on our assumptions. 

Key assumptions include; 

+ How much does robotic milking save labor in *your operation*? 
+ How much does robotic milking enhance *your milk outputs*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for labor shortage and how will it affect *your labor wage rate*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for income over feed cost (IOFC) margin? 


 This online tool helps you simulate the net impacts of robotic milking systems at your farm.  



### Where to start? 
---
1. The first step is to enter your data under **Data Entry** tab. Whether robotic milking is for you crucially depends on the data and assumptions you provide about your current operation, projected changes under robotic milking, and long-term market factors. The analysis involves many data inputs, so please keep in mind that you can download the existing inputs as an Excel file and upload it to pick up where you left off. Those eager to see the analysis resutls may simply skim the data inputs and proceed with the analysis under the default values. To start the analysis, go to **Partial Budget** tab and hit *Calculate*. 

2. The analysis results will be shown under three tabs: **Partial Budget**, **Cash Flow**, and **Data Entry**. 

  *  **Partial Budget**: The top half of the page shows item-by-item impacts of robotic milking for a given budget year, sorted by positive or negative impacts. The bottom half continues the total of positive and negative impacts and adds the considerations for inflations and tax treatment.  Also, the breakeven wage (with the assumed wage inflation rate) and breakeven wage inflation (with the assumed wage rate today) are calculated at the before-tax and after-tax net impacts.   
    

  *  **Cash Flow**: The projection of cash flow is shown in graph and table formats along with the analysis summmary. xIn this view, the changes in operating revenues and expenses are combined with loan payments and tax/tax-deductions. The large capital investment in robots will be followed by large tax deductions through interests and depreciation, bringing down the effective cost of that investment (from the interest rate for the loan and hurdle rate for downpayments). This effective cost is summarized as a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), that is used to convert the stream of cash flows into the net present value (NPV) and its annualized counterpart labeled as ``Net Annual Impact (after-tax)'' throughout our analysis.  


  *  **Data Entry**: Once the analysis is initiated, interactive *dashboard features* will appear in the bottom half of the page. These features show the net annual impact and its compomnents (categoreized in: milk income minus feed cost, labor plus repair cost, cost of capital, other operational changes, and inflation adjustments to the above calculation results for the first year), which respond to the change in your data inputs. This is where you can interactively develop your intuition into how the economics of robotic milking: for example, try making changes in your assumptions on the projected changes under robotic milking and the inflation rates for wage and IOFC margin and how the translate into the results.    


  *  Note: The results shown under the three tabs share the underlying calculations, meaning that all the results come from an unified, single-sterem of calculations that takes your data inputs and makes a projection for the costs and benefits of robotic milking. The three tabs simply show the same analysis from different angles rendering to different arrangements of the calculated items. Notably, the after-tax net annual impact is identical under the three tabs.   



### What's more? 
---
* **Robostness Checks**: Tools that aid assessing the robustness of your results are provided in terms of the change in a key variable (*Sensitivity Analysis*) and the change in a set of related variables (*Scenario Analysis*). 

* **Robots vs Parlors**:  Those interested in comparing investments in alternative milking system options can unlock the *Robots vs Parlors Comparison* feature. It asks for additional inputs on your assumptions regarding the projected changes under alternative investment profiles, including *Barn Only*, *Retrofit Parlors*, *New Parlors*, and *Robots*. The default option, before unlocking the comparison feature, is equivalent to the *Robots* profile.
