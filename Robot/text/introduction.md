## Why robots matter? 
---
Increasingly, dairy producers are facing labor shortages. To reduce labor requirement and potentially increase milk output, some producers have adopted robotic milking systems and many others are said to be considering such investment. Whether you are thinking of getting robotics or only slightly curious how it works financially, this online tool provides a cost and benefit analysis of robotic milking for your farm.   


Installing robots would bring about many changes in your operation and require a large-scale, long-term investment (likely including a major renovation of the barn or the construction of a new barn). Assessing their impact on your operation reqquires a lot of assumptions. 

Key questions pertaining to such assumptions include:

+ How much does robotic milking save labor in *your operation*? 
+ How much does robotic milking enhance *your milk outputs*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for labor shortage and how will it affect *your labor expense*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for income over feed cost (IOFC) margin at *your farm*? 

This online tool assists you with answering such questions. The cost and benefit of robotic milking is also compared with the cost and benefit of Retrofit Parlors or New Parlors.  


## Where to start? 
---
1. The first step is to enter your data under the **Data Entry** tab.  We provide several sets of starting values, of which you will select the most suitable for your operation. However, the results will depend on the data and assumptions you provide about *your operation*, *projected changes* under alternative milking system investments, and *market factors*. The analysis involves many data inputs, so please keep in mind that you can download the existing data-inputs (as an Excel file) and upload it later. Those eager to preview the analysis may do so using the default values. To initiate the analysis, scroll down the page and turn on **Calculation Switch**.  

2. The main results will be shown under three tabs: **Data Entry**, **Partial Budget**, and **Cash Flow**. The three share the same underlying calculation but use different presentations where each has a specific focus. 
  * **Data Entry**: Once the calculation switch is turned on, interactive **Dashboard** will appear on the bottom half of the page. It contains the net annual impact of the investment and its components (milk income minus feed cost, labor plus repair cost, cost of capital, inflation adjustments, and miscellaneous items).  They will be updated as you make changes in your data input. For example, try adjusting the cost of robots or anticipated labor saving. You can use this feature to interactively develop your intuition into the economics of robotic milking.

  *  **Partial Budget**: This tab pesents the details of item-by-item changes under robotic milking. The top half of the page is a Partial Budget Analysis, which organizes the changes under positive and negative impact for a given budget year. The bottom half shows a summary of linkinking the positive-minus-negative change and the annualized net impact through inflation adjustments and tax treatment. An additional analysis of breakeven wage is provided.        
  <br>
  *  **Cash Flow**: This the year-by-year cash flow for investment suitability. Given the long-term nature of investment, understanding the impact of loan payments, tax payments, and tax deductions on the cash flow is crucial.  We derive **After-tax Net Annual Impact**, our final calculation result, as an annualized net present value (NPV) of after-tax cash flow. The results presented in all three tabs (**Data Entry**, **Partial Budget**, and **Cash Flow**) share this value, while they show different ways to break down the impact calculation into components or snapshots. This online tool is not meant to be a blackbox calculator. Instead, it is intended to increase your understanding of the *economics* of robotic milking, so that you make better investment decisions.   
  <br>
  * **Note:** Each section contains the analysis for three investment profiles labeled as **Robots**, **Retrofit Parlors**, and **New Parlors**. The summary of the three profiles is presented under **Summary** tab.   


## What's more? 
---
1. You can assess the robustness of your results with respect to a change in a key variable (**Sensitivity Analysis**) and changes in a set of related variables (**Scenario Analysis**).  
  * **Sensitivity Analysis**: Focusing on ten variables that are deemed most important, assess how well the results hold up under an error in your assumption or an unforeseen change of course.       
  * **Scenario Analysis**: [Under Construction]<br> 


2. Additionally, you can simulate a two-step investment process for the milking system (**Robots**, **Retrofit Parlors**, or **New Parlors**) and the associated housing upgrade. The initial investment is a part or all of the housing investment, and the delayed portion goes into the remainder of the housing investment and the installment of the milking system. This feature can be accessed by setting **Year of Investment** for the milking system (under **Finance** section in **Data Entry**) to be greater than zero. Such a strategy may be attractive for those who want to smoothe cash flows or those who want to adopt modern barn construction while waiting for further technological advances in milking systems.

## Known Issues
--- 
* At the moment the user-input values for **Retrofit** and **New Parlors** profiles that are loaded by default may be unreliable. Please do not take the analysis at its face value. We are working on it to find sound default values.
