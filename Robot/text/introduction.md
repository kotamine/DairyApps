## Why robots matter? 
---
Increasingly dairy producers are facing labor shortage. To reduce labor requirement and potentially increase milk output, some have adopted robotic milking systems and many others are said to be interested in robotic milking for similar reasons. As business owners, it is important to assess the costs and benefits of robotic milking at your farm and determine whether to invest immediately, invest if the case is strengthened in the future, or confidently hold off for a while. In any case, a sound assessment of robotic milking would be worthwhile for many dairy operators.    


Installing robots would affect many parts of the existing operation and require a large-scale, long-term investment (e.g., major renovations of the barn or the construction of a new barn). The calculation needed for this assessment is cumbersome and depends heavily on the assumptions about short-term changes at your farm and long-term changes in the economy.      

Key assumptions include the following; 

+ How much does robotic milking save labor in *your operation*? 
+ How much does robotic milking enhance *your milk outputs*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for labor shortage and how will it affect *your labor expense*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for income over feed cost (IOFC) margin at *your farm*? 


 This online tool assists you with putting these factors in perspective through simulating the impacts of robotic milking systems at your farm. It allows you to assess robotic milking systems relative to alternative investments such as retrofitting existing parlors or installing new parlors. 



## Where to start? 
---
1. The first step is to enter your data under **Data Entry** tab. Whether robotic milking is for you crucially depends on the data and assumptions you provide about your current operation, projected changes under robotic milking, and long-term market factors. The analysis involves many data inputs, so please keep in mind that you can download the existing data-inputs as an Excel file and later upload it. Those eager to preview the analysis resutls may do so using the default values. To initiate the analysis, scroll down a bit and turn on **Calculation Switch**.  

2. The analysis results will be shown under three tabs: **Data Entry**, **Partial Budget**, and **Cash Flow**. The three share the same underlying calculations but present different aspects of the results with each having a different focus. 

  *  **Data Entry**: Once the calculation switch is turned on, interactive *dashboard features* will appear in the bottom half of the page. These features show the net annual impact and its compomnents (categorized into: milk income minus feed cost, labor plus repair cost, cost of capital, other operational changes, and inflation adjustments to the above calculations).  They are updated as you make changes in your data inputs. For example, try adjusting the cost of robots, projected increase in milk output, labor savings, or labor and IOFC margin inflation rates and observe how the results change. You can use this feature to interactively develop your intuition into the economics of robotic milking.  


  *  **Partial Budget**: With the net annual impact and its compomnents from Data Entry in mind, you can examine detailed accounts of item-by-item changes under robotic milking. The top half of the page presents a Partial Budget Analysis for a given budget year, showing positive and negative impacts. The bottom half begins with the positive minus negative impact and provides calculations for inflation adjustments and tax treatments, yielding before-tax and after-tax net impacts. Additionally, the analysis of breakeven wage (at the assumed wage-inflation rate), as well as breakeven wage-inflation rate (at the assumed wage rate in year 1), is provided.    
    

  *  **Cash Flow**: Finally, you can examine the year-by-year cash flow for investment suitability. Given the long-term nature of investment, understanding the impacts of loan payments, tax payments, and tax deductions on the cash flow is crucial. The effective cost of capital after tax treatments, labeled as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), is used to convert the stream of cash flows over the course of years into the net present value (NPV) and then the annualized NPV, which is the definition of the *(After-tax) Net Annual Impact* in this online tool.    


  * **Note:** Each of the three sections above shows the results for the three investment profiles labeled as *Robots*, *Retrofit Parlors*, and *New Parlors*. The summary of the three profiles is provided under **Summary** tab.   


## What's more? 
---
Additional tools are provided for assessing the robustness of your results with respect to change in a key variable (**Sensitivity Analysis**) and change in a set of related variables (**Scenario Analysis**). 

* **Sensitivity Analysis**: Focusing on ten variables that are deemed most important, you can assess how the results hold up under a significant error in your assumption or a unforeseen change of course in the economy.     

* **Scenario Analysis**: [Under Construction]
