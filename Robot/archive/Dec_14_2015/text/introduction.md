### Why robots matter? 
---
Increasing labor shortage is turning dairy producers' attention to robotic milking systems. Robotic milking has a potential to drastically reduce labor requirement and marginally increase milk production. Implementing robots would affect many parts of the existing operation  and requires a large-scale, long-term investment (e.g., major renovations of the barn or the construction of a new barn). Assessing the costs and benefits of robotic milking is complex and heavily dependent on assumptions on short-term changes at the farm and long-term changes in the economy.      

For instance, key assumptions include; 

+ How much does robotic milking save labor in *your operation*? 
+ How much does robotic milking enhance *your milk outputs*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for labor shortage and how will it affect *your labor expenses*? 
+ What is the long-term prospect for income over feed cost (IOFC) margin at *your farm*? 


 This online tool assist you with putting those assumptions in perspective by simulating the impacts of robotic milking systems (and new parlor investement) at your farm.  



### Where to start? 
---
1. The first step is to enter your data under **Data Entry** tab. Whether robotic milking is for you crucially depends on the data and assumptions you provide about your current operation, projected changes under robotic milking, and long-term market factors. The analysis involves many data inputs, so please keep in mind that you can download the existing inputs as an Excel file and later upload it to pick up where you left off. Those eager to preview the analysis resutls may do so using the default values. To initiate the analysis, go to **Partial Budget** tab and hit *Calculate*.  

2. The analysis results will be shown under three tabs: **Partial Budget**, **Cash Flow**, and **Data Entry**. 

  *  **Partial Budget**: The top half of the page shows item-by-item changes under robotic milking for a given budget year, sorted for positive and negative impacts. The bottom half combined the positive and negative impacts and adds considerations for adjusted inflation effects and tax treatments. The main results are before-tax and after-tax net impacts. In addition, the breakeven wage (at the assumed wage-inflation rate), as well as the breakeven wage-inflation rate (at the assumed wage rate in year 1), is presented.     
    

  *  **Cash Flow**: The projection of cash flow is shown in graphs and tables along with a summmary. The cash flow projection shows how loan payments and tax/tax-deductions affect the net operating income. The large capital investment in robots results in large tax deductions for interests and depreciation, which brings down the cost of investment significantly below the interest rate and hurdle rate you provide. This effective cost of capital, labeled as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), is used to convert the stream of cash flows over the course of years into the net present value (NPV) and the annualized NPV, labeled as ``(After-tax) Net Annual Impact'' throughout our analysis.   


  *  **Data Entry**: Once the analysis is initiated, interactive *dashboard features* will appear in the bottom half of the page. These features show the net annual impact and its compomnents (categorized into: milk income minus feed cost, labor plus repair cost, cost of capital, other operational changes, and inflation adjustments to the above calculations), which respond to changes in your data inputs. This is where you can interactively develop your intuition for the economics of robotic milking. For example, try adjusting the cost of robots, projected increase in milk output, labor savings, or labor and IOFC margin inflation rates and observe how that changes the results.    


  *  Note: The results shown under the three tabs share the same underlying calculations, or a unified set of calculations that take your data inputs and make a projection under robotic milking. The three tabs simply show different arrangements of the results, while the after-tax net annual impact is identical as required.    



### What's more? 
---
* **Robostness Checks**: It provides additional tools for assessing the robustness of your results with respect to change in a key variable (*Sensitivity Analysis*) and change in a set of related variables (*Scenario Analysis*). 

* **Robots vs Parlors**: For those interested in comparing investments in alternative milking system options, it allows for *Robots vs Parlors Comparison*, including investment profiles for *Retrofit Parlors*, *New Parlors*, and *Robots*. The default option, before unlocking this feature, is equivalent to the *Robots* profile setting.

## Known Issues
- For some variables in the *dashboard features* under **Data Entry** tab, the response time is very slow. Some features may be taken off in the future.   
- Under Robot vs Parlor Analysis, quickly changing some inputs can cause problems. (This has to do with the input that shows up in two separate places, for which updating the other copy needs some time.)
