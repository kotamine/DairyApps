This is more about a memo than bug report. 

1. Turn on "Sensitivity Analysis", hit "calculate" under Data Tab, "Show sensitivity tool". The graph does not show accurate points for mouse-over. 
2. Change in DM intake should be zero under non-robot profiles
3. The minimum value of "SCC change" should be negative. 
4. Rounding of "Anticipated Labor Change" should be 2 digits. 
5. Sensitivity Cashflow graph is not showing the right values. 
6. Create "Suspend Calculation" button so that the user can change multiple data inputs without being distracted by the series of responses. 
7. Move Breakeven wage chart from Data Entry to Partial Budget. And Create new rows for breakeven wage (instead of having columns with empty rows).
